1.  Add the generic_small.xml file to the game installation folder in the following path:

(You can find this file in the project folder at: resources/generic_small.xml).
2. Run the flight simulator
3. Select the 'honolulu' map
4.  Write these lines at the bottom of the 'settings' page in the simulator:
     --telnet=socket,in,10,127.0.0.1,5402,tcp
     --generic=socket,out,10,127.0.0.1,5400,tcp,generic_small

8. Press 'fly' in the simulator
9. Once it starts, go to the 'cessna 172p' button and press 'autostart'
